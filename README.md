# STM32CubeMX and STemWin

STM32CubeMX and STemWin for TFT display.  
In this example I used a ST7789 driver with TFT display with a resolution of 320x240
and a nucleo board 64 with a STM32F103RBT6.
The interface is 8-bit parallel.
In this repository i used the graphic library without a touch screen
